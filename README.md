## Project Overview

This project overview is subject to change as the project evolves.
The Knox County Department of Watershed is currently using a closed-source data management system to store data on water usage, service calls, customer status, and other critical metric for serving paying customers who tap into city water service. The Department of Watershed serves anyone in Knox County, including residents of Mount Vernon, Gambier, and the surrounding areas. This project is designed to pull old data from saved CSV files and make them accessible to modern software packages, while increasing the ease of use for the end user.

## Specifications

As we continue to work on this project, the specifications will be developed and modified as the developers and clients see fit to best serve the needs of the greater community as a long term solution. The system is planning on being deployed on existing server platforms provided by the local government. Depending on our abilities, we may choose to utilize some sort of containerization technology, like Kubernetes, to better serve the clients and to make the applications highly scalable.

## Installation

No specification is being outlined for installation, as this is all custom software.

## Dependencies

- mysqli PHP extension
